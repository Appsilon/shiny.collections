Version: 0.1.0
Author: Filip Stachura <filip@appsilondatascience.com>
Maintainer: Marek Rogala <marek@appsilondatascience.com>
Description: Storing persistent data in Shiny apps is not trival.
    One have to directly write to files, databases, etc. This package
    is inspired by how collections work in Meteor (https://www.meteor.com/).
    Not only they are persistent, but also synchronized in real time
    between all Shiny sessions.
